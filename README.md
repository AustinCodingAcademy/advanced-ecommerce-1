#### Setup
Fork, clone, run yarn install, yarn start, pull request

#### Do
 * Organize this web page into appropriate components
   * ProductDetail
   * Header
   * Footer
   * Carousel
 * Create a component folder to hold component files
 * Make sure each component is in its own file and imported into App.js
 * Use the provided data in state.js to dynamically populate information instead of the hard coded html that is there now.
* Remember to use props
* App should map the array of products into an array of ProductDetails
* ProductDetail should take one product
* Make the star images represent the number rating from data
